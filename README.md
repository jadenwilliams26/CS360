The goal of the weight tracking app was to create a simple, unbiased tool that allowed users to either gain or lose weight according to their personal goals. The app addressed the need for flexible, user-driven tracking without pushing a specific fitness agenda, making it accessible and supportive for a wide range of users.

To meet user needs and build a user-centered UI, I designed clear, minimal screens: a home dashboard, a goal-setting screen, and a weigh-in update screen. The UI focused on simplicity, easy navigation, and clean feedback to users about their progress. By minimizing clutter and prioritizing essential functions, the designs stayed intuitive and kept users engaged, contributing to a successful user experience.

I approached coding the app by breaking the project into smaller, manageable parts and building each feature step-by-step. Techniques like modular coding, commenting, and regular testing helped maintain organization and catch issues early. These strategies can be reused in future projects to keep development efficient and scalable.

To ensure functionality, I conducted regular testing after every major code change, checking for bugs and making sure user inputs were handled correctly. Testing was critical because it revealed minor issues with input validation and helped confirm that the app responded accurately to different user goals.

Throughout the design and development process, one major innovation came when designing a flexible goal-setting system â€” creating a structure that worked equally well for users trying to gain or lose weight without needing separate workflows.

One component where I demonstrated strong knowledge and skills was in building the weigh-in update feature. I successfully connected user inputs to goal tracking logic, ensuring a smooth and responsive experience that updated progress dynamically based on user activity.
